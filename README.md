MUSIC PREDICTION SYSTEM

A machine learning project that is a subset of AI.Its a trending topic.Traditional techniques are uses rules that need to follow fixed of rules-this is very disadvantageous because in the ever evolving world the dat keeps getting added to the prediction set so we’ll need to keep extending the ruled that we’ve formulated which is a very tedious process.Therefore we use Machine learning.A technique where a huge amount of data is fed to the system.A model is build to find patterns in the data set so in the future when unknown data is fed then it can easily be predicted.
Applications
self driving cars
Robotics
Language processing
Vision processing
Forecasting stock market trends

STEPS IN MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT

Import data-usually in the form of a csv file
Clean the data-irrelevant data must be removed,numerical conversion,duplicates handled.
Split the data into training and testing sets
Create a model-various algorithms present based on the data we are working with.
Train Model
Make Predictions
Evaluate the results and Improvise-we can evaluate the performance of the model.in case of underwhelming results we can fine tune the model parameters or even choose a different algorithm.

LIBRARIES AND TOOLS

1.Numpy-multidimensional arrays

2.pandas-Data frame 

3.Matplotlib-2d visualization library

4.Scikit Learn-provides the algorithms required


Jupyter notebook is used to develop the project
Source code organized as cells,that saves the output of each cell.Autocomplete is available.
